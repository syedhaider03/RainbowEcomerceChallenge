## Atomic Design Pattern

I decided to implement the atomic design pattern in this project because it offers several advantages in terms of scalability, maintainability, and reusability. Essentially, atomic design involves breaking down UI components into smaller, reusable elements such as atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This approach promotes consistency and modular development, which makes it easier to manage and scale projects over time.

### Design Inspiration

- Most of the Design inspiration taken from Dribbble.
- Products page UI is based on the provided screenshot.

- I had almost finished designing a similar UI for the product display. However, I had to modify it to fit the available data through API.

### Environment File

Please make sure to add an `.env` file in the root folder of the project. This file should contain necessary environment variables, particularly for APIs to function properly.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
